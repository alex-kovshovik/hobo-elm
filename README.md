- Add view/edit expense detail page (no save yet)
- Refactor application into multiple components
- Add routing for list vs view/edit, based on elm-lang/navigation
- Some routing code is ugly, I'm considering changing it to use sporto/hop.

- Size of compiled JS reduced by 40% - just due to Elm upgrade
